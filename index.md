### The Life of of my Robot (Toto) in Pictures and some Text

To check out the code, head over to my repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/raghav2956/Cornell-University-ECE3400)


### Week 1

In week 1, we put together Toto's structural frame and got familiar with the Arduino, the microncontroller that is supposed to act
as her brains. Other things involved ->

1. Getting familiar with the Photoresistors that would act as Toto's 'eyes'.
2. Playing around with the Analog to Digital converter on the arduino to read the values off the photoresistors. We talked about the 
   significance of the reference voltage, the sampling rate and the resolution.
